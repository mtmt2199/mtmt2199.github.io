In the world of martial arts and combat sports, your hands are your primary tools. However, the human hand is a complex structure of small bones not naturally designed to strike hard objects. This is where "Knuckle Skills" (ナックル・スキルス) come into play.

Knuckle skills refer to the methodology of conditioning the fists (body hardening) and mastering the technical alignment required to deliver powerful strikes without sustaining self-injury, such as the infamous "Boxer’s Fracture."


### 1. Conditioning: Building "Iron Fists"

True knuckle strength isn't just about calloused skin; it’s about bone density. According to **Wolff’s Law**, bone adapts to the loads under which it is placed. By applying consistent, controlled stress, you can make your knuckles denser and harder.
